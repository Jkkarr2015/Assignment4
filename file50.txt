The popular name of the condition is originated due to the inconstance (or undulance) of the fever, which raises and falls constantly. Brucellosis is named after its researcher David Bruce. Maltese doctor and archaeologist Sir Temi Zammit identified unpasteurized milk as the major source of the pathogen in 1905, and it has since become known as Malta Fever, or deni rqiq locally.

In animals this disease is also known as contagious abortion and infectious abortion. In 1897 Danish veterinarian Bernhard Bang isolated Brucella abortus as the agent and the additional name Bang's disease was assigned. In modern usage "Bang's disease" is often corrupted to just "bangs" when ranchers discuss the disease or vaccine.
Brucellosis induces inconstant fevers, sweating, weakness, anorexia, headaches, depression and muscular and bodily pain.

The symptoms are like those associated with many other febrile diseases, but with emphasis on muscular pain and sweating. The duration of the disease can vary from a few weeks to many months or even years.

The disease's sequelae are highly variable and may include granulomatous hepatitis, arthritis, spondylitis, anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, meningitis, uveitis, optic neuritis and endocarditis.
