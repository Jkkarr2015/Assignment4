Gastrectomy is surgery to remove part or all of the stomach. 
The patient is under general anesthesia (unconscious and pain-free). An incision is made in the abdomen. A portion or all of the stomach -- depending on the indication -- is dissected free from surrounding tissues, its blood supply is controlled and ligated (sewn off), and then the stomach or part of it can be removed.

Depending on the type of operation, the intestine is then reconnected to the remaining stomach (in the case of a partial gastrectomy) or to the esophagus (in the case of a total gastrectomy).
