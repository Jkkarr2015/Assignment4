Cranial mononeuropathy VI is a disorder that causes double vision, associated with dysfunction of cranial nerve VI, which is responsible for moving the eye to the side.
Cranial mononeuropathy VI is a mononeuropathy (damage to a single nerve) involving the sixth cranial (abducens) nerve, one of the cranial nerves that controls eye movement.

Abducens nerve disorders are often associated with diabetic neuropathy, trauma, infections (like meningitis or sinusitis), infarction (tissue damage from loss of blood flow), cranial aneurysms, tumors, or increased intracranial pressure (pressure within the skull). In some cases, no cause can be found.

Because of common pathways through the skull, other cranial nerves (such as the third or fourth cranial nerve) may be affected simultaneously.
