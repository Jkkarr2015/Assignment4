Hyphema is blood in the front chamber of the eye, usually caused by trauma to the eye. 
Hyphema is usually caused by trauma to the eye, which may be a blunt or perforating injury. Severe inflammation of the iris, a blood vessel abnormality, or cancer of the eye may occasionally cause bleeding into the front chamber.

A layering of blood in front of the iris can be noticed when the person remains upright for a while. Acute glaucoma can occur suddenly in this condition.
