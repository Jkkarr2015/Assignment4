 A disorder in which the lining of the esophagus (the tube which carries food from the throat to the stomach) has cellular changes caused by irritation from stomach acid which has leaked into the esophagus. This leakage of acid is commonly known as "heartburn" (gastroesophageal reflux).
Medications to relieve symptoms and control gastroesophageal reflux include antacids after meals and at bedtime, Histamine H2 receptor blockers, proton pump inhibitors, cholinergic agents, and promotility agents.

Surgery to remove a portion of the esophagus (resection of the esophagus) may be indicated, if a biopsy shows the type of cellular changes that tend to lead to cancer (dysplasia).
