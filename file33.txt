A hernia occurs when part of an organ (usually the intestines) protrudes through a weak point or tear in the thin muscular wall that holds the abdominal organs in place.

There are several types of hernias, based on where it occurs:

Inguinal hernia -- appears as a bulge in the groin or into the scrotum. This type is more common in men than women. 
Femoral hernia -- appears as a bulge in the upper thigh. This type is more common in women than in men. 
Incisional hernia -- can occur through a scar if you had abdominal surgery. 
Umbilical hernia -- a bulge around the belly button. It happens if the muscular ring around the navel does not close completely.
Usually, there is no obvious cause of a hernia, although they are sometimes associated with heavy lifting.

Hernias can be seen in infants and children. This can happen when the lining around the abdominal organs does not close properly before birth. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, 5 out of 100 children have inguinal hernias (more boys than girls). Some may not have symptoms until adulthood.
