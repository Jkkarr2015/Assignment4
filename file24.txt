Ganglioneuroma is a usually-benign tumor of the peripheral nervous system. 
Ganglioneuromas are rare tumors which occur in approximately 1 in 100,000 children. They most frequently arise in association with autonomic nerve cells, which may be in any part of the body.

Ganglioneuromas most frequently occur in people between age 10 and 40. They are slow growing masses and may secrete neurochemicals or hormones. Most commonly, they are asymptomatic and discovered in the course of a normal exam or during treatment for some other condition.

Though there are no known risk factors, some reports suggests that they may be associated with some genetic problems, for instance, "neurofibromatosis type 1."

If the tumor is in the mediastinum (chest), it may cause chest pain, difficulty breathing, or compression of the trachea. If the tumor is in the retro-peritoneal space (lower in the abdomen), it may result in abdominal pain and distension. If the tumor is near the spinal cord, it may cause spine deformity and possible compression of the spinal cord.

Active hormone secretion may produce diarrhea, sweating, high blood pressure, and symptoms of virilization like increased body hair or enlarged clitoris in females if testosterone is being secreted.
