Giardia lamblia (formerly also Lamblia intestinalis and also known as Giardia duodenalis and Giardia intestinalis) is a flagellated protozoan parasite that infects the gastrointestinal tract and causes giardiasis.
Infection causes giardiasis, a type of gastroenteritis that manifests itself with severe diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Other symptoms can include bloating, flatulence, fatigue, nausea, vomiting and weight loss. In some patients, vomiting or nausea is the major symptom. The symptoms usually manifest themselves about seven to ten days after ingestion. Giardia is a major cause of intestinal disease worldwide and the most frequent non-bacterial cause of diarrhea in North America. Nonetheless, the basic biology of this parasite is poorly understood.
