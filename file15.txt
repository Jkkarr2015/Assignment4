Fluid-filled conjunctiva; Swollen eye or conjunctiva.
 Chemosis is a condition in which the membranes that line the eyelids and surface of the eye (conjunctiva) are swollen. The outer surface covering appears to have fluid in it. Often, the conjunctiva become so swollen that the eyes cannot close properly.
Initial attempts to treat angioedema or allergies include use of over-the-counter antihistamines. Cool cloths held over the eyes can relieve some of the discomfort associated with chemosis. If these don't work, topical antihistamines from your eye doctor can often help.

Chemosis can also be associated with infections of the eye such as viral conjunctivitis ("pink eye"). In these cases, the eyes are also red. Cool compresses will help but treatment for the infection may be needed as well.
