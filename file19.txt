The flu usually begins abruptly, with a fever between 102 to 106 degrees (with adults on the lower end of the spectrum). Other common symptoms include a flushed face, body aches, and lack of energy. Some people have symptoms such as dizziness or vomiting. The fever usually lasts for a day or two, but can last five days.

Somewhere between day 2 and day 4 of the illness, the "whole body" symptoms begin to subside, and respiratory symptoms begin to increase. The virus can settle anywhere in the respiratory tract, producing symptoms of a cold, croup, sore throat, bronchiolitis, ear infection, or pneumonia.

The most prominent of the respiratory symptoms is usually a dry, hacking cough. Most people also develop a sore (red) throat and a headache. Nasal discharge and sneezing are common. These symptoms (except the cough) usually disappear within 4-7 days. Sometimes there is a second wave of fever at this time. The cough and tiredness usually last for weeks after the rest of the illness is over.

The most common way to catch the flu is by inhaling droplets from coughs or sneezes. Less often, it is spread when you touch a surface such as a faucet handle or phone that has the virus on it, and then touch your own mouth, nose, or eyes.

Symptoms appear 1-7 days later (usually with 2-3 days). Because the flu is airborne and very contagious, with a short incubation period, it often slams into a community all at once. This creates a cluster of school and work absences. The flu usually arrives in the winter months. Within 2 or 3 weeks of its arrival in a school, much of the classroom has had it.

Tens of millions of people in the United States get the flu each year. Most recover within a week or two, but about 114,000 people each year get sick enough to be hospitalized, and about 36,000 people die each year from the flu.
