Calcification is a process in which the mineral calcium builds up in tissue, causing it to harden. This can be a normal or abnormal process.
Ninety-nine percent (99%) of calcium entering the body is deposited in bones and teeth and the remaining 1% of calcium is dissolved in the blood. When a disorder affects the balance between calcium and other minerals or hormones, calcium can be deposited in other parts of the body, such as arteries, kidneys, lungs, brain. Calcium deposits in these parts of the body can cause problems with the function of these organs.
