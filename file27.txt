Gastroparesis is a condition in which the stomach's ability to empty its contents is impaired, unrelated to obstruction.
The cause is unknown, but disruption of nerve stimulation to the intestine may be responsible. The condition is a common complication of diabetes and can be a complication of some surgeries. Risk factors for gastroparesis include diabetes, systemic sclerosis, previous vagotomy, previous gastrectomy, visceral neuropathy, and use of anticholinergic medication.
