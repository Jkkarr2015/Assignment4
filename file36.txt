A hiccup is a sound produced by unintentional movement of the muscle at the base of the lungs (diaphragm) followed by rapid closure of the vocal cords. 
Hiccups often start for no apparent reason and usually disappear after a few minutes. Rarely, hiccups can persist for days, weeks, or months. 
Common Causes
Noxious fumes 
Hot and spicy foods or liquids 
Any disease or disorder that irritates the nerves that control the diaphragm (such as pleurisy or pneumonia) 
Stroke or tumor affecting the "hiccup center" in the brain 
Abdominal surgery 
There is no sure way to stop hiccups, but there are a number of common suggestions that may be effective: 
Hold your breath. 
Breathe repeatedly into a paper bag. 
Drink a glass of cold water. 
Eat a teaspoon of sugar.
