Discoloration (blue or black if skin is affected; red or bronze if the affected area is beneath the skin) 
Loss of sensation (which may occur after severe pain in the area) 
Foul-smelling discharge 
If the affected area is internal (such as gangrene of the gallbladder or gas gangrene), the symptoms may include: 

Persistent or severe pain 
Fever 
Gas in tissues beneath the skin 
General ill feeling 
Septic shock
