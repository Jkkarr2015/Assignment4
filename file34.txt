Hepatitis is inflammation of the liver. 
The disease can be caused by:

Infections from parasites, bacteria, or viruses (such as Hepatitis A, B, or C)
Liver damage from alcohol, drugs, or poisonous mushrooms
An overdose of acetaminophen (such as Tylenol), which is rare but can be deadly (more common if you drink alcohol regularly)
Immune cells in the body attacking the liver and causing autoimmune hepatitis
Other medications that can cause damage to the liver include methyldopa (used uncommonly for high blood pressure), isoniazide for tuberculosis, seizure medications (like valproate and phenytoin), chlorpromazine, amiodarone (for irregular heart rhythm), and certain antibiotics (including trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and erythromycin). If you need to take any of these, your doctor will follow your liver function closely.

Liver disease can also be caused by inherited disorders such as cystic fibrosis and Wilson's disease, a condition that involves having too much copper in your body; the excess copper deposits in organs like your liver.

Hepatitis may start and resolve quickly (acute hepatitis), or cause long-term disease (chronic hepatitis). In some instances, progressive liver damage, liver failure, or even liver cancer may result.

The severity of hepatitis depends on many factors, including the cause of the liver damage and any underlying illnesses you have. Hepatitis A, for example, is generally short-lived, not leading to chronic liver problems.
