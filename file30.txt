Gingivitis is a disorder involving inflammation of the gums (gingiva). 
Gingivitis is a form of periodontal disease . Periodontal disease is when inflammation and infection destroy the tissues that support the teeth, including the gingiva (gums), the periodontal ligaments, and the tooth sockets (alveolar bone).

Gingivitis is caused by the long-term effects of plaque deposits. Plaque is a sticky material that develops on the exposed portions of the teeth, consisting of bacteria, mucus, and food debris. It is a major cause of tooth decay. Unremoved plaque mineralizes into a hard deposit called tartar that becomes trapped at the base of the tooth. Plaque and tartar irritate and inflame the gingiva. Bacteria, and the toxins bacteria produce, cause the gums to become infected, swollen, and tender.

Injury or trauma to the gums from any cause, including overly vigorous brushing or flossing of the teeth, can also cause gingivitis. The risks for developing gingivitis include uncontrolled diabetes, pregnancy (because of hormonal changes that increase the sensitivity of the gingiva), general illness, and poor dental hygiene.

Misaligned teeth, rough edges of fillings, and ill fitting or unclean mouth appliances (such as orthodontic appliances, dentures, bridges, and crowns) can irritate the gums and increase the risk of gingivitis. Medications such as phenytoin and birth control pills, and ingestion of heavy metals such as lead and bismuth are also associated with gingivitis.

Many people experience gingivitis to a varying degree. It usually develops during puberty or early adulthood due to hormonal changes and may persist or recur frequently, depending on how healthy your teeth and gums are.
