Heterochromia is the presence of different colored eyes in the same person. 
This condition is relatively rare in humans. However, heterochromia appears quite commonly in dogs (such as Dalmatians and Australian sheep dogs), cats, and horses.

Heterochromia in humans can appear either as a hereditary trait unassociated with other disease, or as a symptom of various syndromes. Rock star David Bowie has heterochromia.
