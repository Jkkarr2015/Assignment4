Leprosy, also known as Hansen's disease, is an infectious disease caused by a DNA plasmid (transposon, or "ultravirus", a small circle of DNA) carried in Hansen's bacillus (the Mycobacterium leprae bacterium) which is thus the vector. The plasmid can exist separately from the bacterial chromosome, and from the bacterium, when it invades human nerves; Hansen's Disease may disfigure the body or skin. The modern, non-stigmatising term for the disease is named after Gerhard Armauer Hansen, the discoverer of the bacterium.
