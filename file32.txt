Herpangina is a viral illness characterized by ulcers and lesions inside the mouth, sore throat, and fever. If similar shallow blister-like lesions appear on the palms or soles, it may be called hand, foot, and mouth disease. 
Herpangina is caused by Coxsackie virus, typically Coxsackie group A viruses. Herpangina is characterized by mouth ulcers, but a high fever, sore throat, and headache may precede the appearance of the lesions. The lesions are generally ulcers with a white to whitish-gray base and a red border -- usually on the roof of the mouth and in the throat. The ulcers may be very painful. Generally, there are only a few lesions. 

The incidence of herpangina is unknown, but it is a common childhood infection. A history of herpangina at school or in the neighborhood increases the chances your child will develop the illness.
