 Chancroid is a disease known to be spread solely through sexual contact.
Chancroid is a bacterial infection caused by the organism Haemophilus ducreyi. It is a disease found primarily in developing and third world countries.

Only a few hundred cases a year are diagnosed in the United States. The majority of individuals in the U.S. diagnosed with chancroid have traveled outside the country to areas where the disease is known to occur frequently.

Uncircumcised men are at 3 times the risk of circumcised men for contracting chancroid from an infected partner. Chancroid is a risk factor for contracting the HIV virus.
